Lucas Gerbsch Assignment Summary

This project was good hands-on experience with ML models and understanding how the tradeoffs that come with balancing priorities directly affect business decisions. Avoiding big losses is important in the airline industry so accounting for the rare, but damaging, diversion is important. Being overly prepared and losing some time and money is a far better fate than having a sudden and unexpected diversion that then causes the whole airport staff to scramble. This extends beyond the airport as vouchers, hotels, food, and travel plans must all be thrown together in the madness which only increases the costs to expedite. 

The default model fell far short by failing to predict diversions all together while almost always being accurate about non-diversions. While high accuracy may seem good, the core business concern is diversions so being accurate on the non-important target is not very helpful. The model didn’t properly weight the rare class and since there were so few compared to the abundance of non-diverted flights, they got drowned out. As a result, I chose to go with an auto-weighting model that weighs the rare class heavily since it’s what we care about rather than picking a specific threshold cutoff. 

My model ended up at around 95% success at capturing diversions while still maintaining around 60% accuracy for non-diversions, which isn’t a bad tradeoff in this context. I also convinced my team that weighing was the best for this scenario because of the high risk and damage implications of missing a diversion. I did some research and found that unexpected diversions cost airlines tens of thousands of dollars all the way up to multiple hundreds of thousands because of the mass reallocation of resources required and the disruption of their workflows. This becomes especially crucial as we move into the winter season where these delays become more prevalent, significantly increasing the financial damage if they’re not properly prepared for. 

This damage extends beyond just their financials though as poor customer service, planning, and compensation in the event of a diversion creates significant brand damage to the airline company. This not only puts a big chunk in their revenue, but also their long term ability to stay relevant and bring in new customers. Ensuring that our customers are as happy as possible and properly cared for is the right decision when it comes to mitigating risk to the company and allocating resources in the event of emergencies.

Executive Summary: Leonard Chiu Flight Diversion Prediction Model 

This project focused on developing and evaluating a Logistic Regression model using BigQuery ML to predict flight diversion. The primary goal was to create a deployable tool to forecast the rare, but extremely high-cost, operational disruption using flight data. The BQML framework allowed for iteration between baseline modeling and advanced feature engineering directly within the data warehouse.
Key Project Learnings:
The most significant finding was the essential role of feature engineering in classifying an event characterized by extreme data sparsity. The initial baseline model was negligible predictive value. The engineered features, specifically the route  and the dep_delay_bucketized, were crucial for meaningful predictive context. The route feature captures micro-level operational risk specific to airport pairs, while bucketing the delay data  manages non-linear relationships, allowing the model to distinguish between a small, recoverable delay and a critically severe delay. Due to these efforts, the Engineered Model's ROC AUC score improved dramatically from the expected random guess baseline around 0.50 to 0.6214. This confirms the new features added significant predictive power, allowing the model to effectively rank and separate high-risk flights from low-risk flights.

Where the Model Failed (at Default Settings)
Despite the strong ROC AUC improvement, the model failed to perform successfully on critical operational metrics at the default 0.5 prediction threshold. Specifically, the model returned 0.0 for both Precision and Recall across the evaluation set. This meant the model, when evaluated conventionally, failed to successfully identify a single true diversion. This failure was not due to a lack of predictive power (the ROC AUC proved the model could rank risk) but was fundamentally caused by the extreme class imbalance. The model, observing the vast majority of non-diversions, learned that the overall probability of diversion was so low that its highest predicted probability for any flight rarely, if ever, exceeded the 0.5 threshold, resulting in zero positive classifications and the appearance of total failure.

Recommended Deployment Threshold
Given the cost disparity between prediction errors, operational deployment must prioritize Recall. The cost of a False Negative is catastrophic in terms of passenger disruption, regulatory fines, and resource scrambling, while the cost of a False Positive is somewhat more manageable. Therefore, the model recommended for deployment is the Engineered Model due to its confirmed predictive power (ROC AUC approximately 0.62). The recommended deployment threshold is 0.1, a low setting. A low threshold is necessary to force the model to classify high-risk flights as 'Diverted' despite the low probability scale caused by class imbalance. This approach maximizes Recall, ensuring maximum operational preparedness and minimizing the financial and operational damage of a missed prediction. The final model can be deployed on Vertex AI for low-latency, real-time, scalable inference, supported by continuous monitoring of its performance and automated retraining.

# Purdue MGMT 467 Unit 1 Assignment README
This assignment uses Google Colab and the BigQuery public dataset "TheLook_ecommerce" to encourage people to investigate the mock ecommerce business 'TheLook' and find insights. Each student has uploaded a DIVE ipynb in the individual subdirectory which encourages them to Discover, Investigate, Validate, and Extend along with a summary of their findings. Within this directory you'll find an executive brief and a prompts log that contains the prompts from all of the students DIVE's. The executive brief uses the insights generated by the team to create a wholistic plan forward to support 'TheLook' and support their continued growth. In the assets subdirectory, you'll find screenshots of a comprehensive Looker Studio dashboard along with screenshots of visualizations from each student's DIVE ipynb.   
## Steps to reproduce
Dataset: bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce  
Tools: Google Colab, Gemini AI, BigQuery SQL, Plotly, Looker Studio  
Method: DIVE (Discover • Investigate • Validate • Extend)

Context: You’re the analytics team for “The Look,” an online retailer. Leadership wants a fast, cost-effective analytics pack that (a) surfaces growth opportunities and risks and (b) proposes specific, near-term actions.

## Discover:
- Identify the top 3 growth KPIs for the business
- Use CTEs and window functions to compute trends and MoM/YoY growth for at least one KPI.

## Investigate:
- Deep dive into one product category and one customer segment.
- Use AI-assisted SQL to explore drivers (discounts, marketing channel if available, region, device).

## Validate:
- Cross-check at least two AI-generated insights with alternative queries or counterexamples. 
- Show at least one case where the first answer was misleading and how you corrected it.

## Extend:
- Build one interactive Plotly chart in Colab and one executive Looker Studio dashboard with:
        - Scorecard: revenue (or profit), last 30 days
        - Pie Chart: sales % by region or channel
        - Bar Chart: top 5 products/categories
- Write 1–2 specific recommendations using the Strategist pattern.

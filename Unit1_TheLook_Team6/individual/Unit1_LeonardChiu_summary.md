There were many interesting observations exploring thelook e-commerce dataset. First, the average order value seemed to fluctuate quite a bit; it did not matter whether it was 2019 or 2025. For example, the average order value in 2019 June was 91.63, while in June 2025 it was 85.51. After initial observations, I moved on into investigating the product category sweaters and also the region Europe. I was surprised to discover the Guangdong, a singular province, had 13k more revenue than the second place region, England, which is an entire country. In addition, Shanghai, a city, is in fourth place. From the data I also discovered that the number of orders could be correlated with total revenue but is not a determinant of revenue due to the different prices for each item. Chrome is the most used browser by total_revenue by a lot, although in Europe it really varies by country. The number of orders in Europe increased a lot as time went on. The plot I made (total sweater revenue by region) shows in perspective how great the demand for sweaters is in Guangdong.

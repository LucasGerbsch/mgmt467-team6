There were a lot of interesting findings during my investigation of TheLook_ecommerce dataset. The first that was immediately noticed was that there was large month over month growth for the first year or two due to being a startup, but as the customer base grew the monthly revenue growth began to slow down and take on a more natural, linear progression. This is expected as stability increases due to the company beginning to establish a name for itself. We see a similar trend in the year-over-year growth where distribution is shaped like a U. There is high, but cyclical decreasing year-over-year growth in the first 2 years after creation where the company focused on bringing in as many new customers as possible until it reaches the growth present in 2023. By this point the company has had time to establish itself and grow a sizeable customer base. The company then analyzes their data and feedback to create a strategy to begin growing their year-over-year revenue again. This results in a 6% growth in revenue in 2024, but only a 0.77% growth in 2025. Their previous year’s revenue is much higher now compared to when the company was in its’ infancy so it makes sense that the increase is far smaller than the 86% we saw in 2020, but the 0.77% increase this year shows that the business is really struggling to adapt to changing consumer tastes. The business’ email and adwords  marketing channels are particularly successful, pointing towards a potential path forward and target for future resources. Another key insight is that Google Chrome stood out as the primary browser of choice for roughly half of the revenue brought in. Coming from a western nation, I wanted to explore an eastern country with western connections to see how the business’ practices held up. Surprisingly emails and adwords still remained the big ticket marketing channels and Google Chrome was still the most successful browser.
The prompt that changed after validation was making the year-over-year growth condensed and display each year with the respective info instead of still displaying each month, year pair with distorted information. This was crucial for my analysis because it showed the real total revenue value for each year which helped contextualize company earnings and correctly compute the year-over-year revenue growth %. 
My recommendation is that the company spends resources optimizing and increasing their email marketing. It’s clear through multiple product categories, especially accessories, that email marketing is a key channel that drives revenue and gets great ROI. This also remains true when investigating a large eastern commerce player like Japan which shows that this channel does have resilience in foreign markets. The company needs to analyze past marketing campaigns to determine which failed and succeeded and the reasoning. They can then use that information to create strategies for future campaigns and ramp up the quantity of emails they’re sending out.

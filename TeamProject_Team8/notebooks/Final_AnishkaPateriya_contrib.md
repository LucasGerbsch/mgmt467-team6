My lookerstudio data was not put into the overall dashboard section due to the timing of my availibility to complete it + 
the things I investigated did not seem to have much of a correlation, so it wouldn't make sense to input it into the dashboard
 regardless.

My personal analysis is included in this folder itself.

Lessons Learned:
Using a real time API and past data to train a model is really useful, especially in business contexts, because while a
company like CitiBike, Uber, the local Public Transportation company, etc. may not record things out of their control, like
the weather, it may have a huge impact on their business model and services. 

I also learned a lot about combining Real Time Data with prior data and the technical knowhow behind this. 

Additionally, I learned that even though it might technically make sense for certain variables to have a large impact on other
variables (eg. rainfall to have a large impact on number/length of Citibike rides), it may not always work as you thought, and
so its important to do a lot of investigation.
